<strong>Introduction</strong><br />

<p>
PureMVC for ColdFusion is a lightweight framework based on the PureMVC 2.0 AS3 Reference implementation for creating 
applications based upon the classic Model-View-Controller design pattern.
</p>

<p>
This implementation of the framework is still being tested and needs more documentation, demos, and utilities, but 
has all the functionality of the 2.0 AS3 Reference implementation.
