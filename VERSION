--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0	-	Added final comments and updated examples to the build archive. - MJO

0.9 - 	All unit tests passed. AS3 2.0 functionality. Supporting documentation outside of code base
		must still be created. Most code has reasonable documentation to get started but I am sure
		there are areas which will require deeper explaination. - MJO

0.8 -	All unit tests passed. AS3 1.7 functionality. Added additional comments so CFCDoc and provide a 
		little more information. Would like to find	free tool to display API without CF Server running 
		but this will have to do for now. - MJO

0.7 -	Added more comments and documentation to cfc's. Created HelloWorld and LoginApp examples. Decided to
		utilize CFCDoc to use as tool to present API. All unit tests passed. AS3 1.5 functionality. - MJO
		
0.6 -	IViewHelper now extends IViewComponent after discovering thru unit testing that Mediators are not just
		ment for composite views but technically could be used with other objects. - MJO
		
0.5 -	Added solution for hard coded switch statement in notifyObserver() method of the Observer class. Added
		an applyNotifyMethod() to the IController and INotifier interfaces. applyNotification() takes an
		INotification. So, now anything that implements IController or INotifier must implement the a
		applyNotifyMethod(). This works like a charm because now he Controller can fire off the executeCommand()
		when applyNotifyMethod() is called and the Notified class in fire off its handleNotification() method
		when its applyNotifyMethod() is called. Polymorphism is great in this situation :). - MJO

0.4 -	Implemented the Model, View, and Controller. Had to hard code a switch statement into the 
		notifyObserver() method of the Observer class for now until I figure out how to best implement the
		apply() method which is available in AS3 but not available in ColdFusion. - MJO

0.3 -	Implemented the rest of the interfaces into their concreate implementations. Came to realization we
		will have to add an IViewHelper and ViewHelper pattern to act as the viewComponent in CF since HTML
		is not considered an object to ColdFusion code. The ViewHelper will act as the view which is passed into
		the Mediator. - MJO
		
0.2 - 	Converted all the interfaces which are a part of the PureMVC AS3 interface core. Implemented Proxy 
		and Mediator patterns. - MJO

0.1 - 	Initial project structure created in repository - CLH
